# Movies ETL

## Overview
Create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. Refactoring of code is a core data analytics concept and key to creating one function that takes in three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
